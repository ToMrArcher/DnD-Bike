# DnD Bike
An app for cool DMs that like to do stuff quickly.

## Requirements

Well.. you need Node.JS. So there is that.
You might also want to get yourself a mongodb database setup. This project asumes that you are setting it up on your local machine and are using localhost:3000 and standard mongo ports. I don't personally understand what I just wrote, so if its dumb, ignore me. 


**NPM packages**

    npm init

 - `npm install express --save`
 - `npm install body-parser --save`
 - `npm  install request --save`
 - `npm install mongoose --save`

To start, just use the badass 

    node app.js

command.
